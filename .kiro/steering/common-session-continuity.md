# Session Continuity

## Resuming an Existing Sprint

When resuming work on an existing AI-DLC sprint, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Load Current State from Graph
Call `get_sprint_graph` to load all existing artifacts and understand the current state of the sprint.

### Step 2: Analyze Sprint Status
From the Sprint node properties, determine:
- **Current Phase**: INCEPTION, CONSTRUCTION, or REVIEW
- **Current Stage**: The specific stage in progress

From the presence of graph nodes, determine what has been completed:
- **Requirement nodes exist** -> Requirements Analysis is complete
- **UserStory nodes exist** -> User Stories stage is complete
- **Task nodes exist** -> Units Generation / planning is complete
- **CodeFile nodes exist** -> Code Generation has started or completed
- **Review nodes exist** -> Review process has started

### Step 3: Present Status Summary
Present the current status to the team:

```
Welcome back! Based on the sprint graph, here's your current status:
- **Current Phase**: [phase from Sprint node]
- **Current Stage**: [stage from Sprint node]
- **Artifacts**: [count] Requirements, [count] User Stories, [count] Tasks, [count] Code Files
- **Carried-Forward Context**: [count] artifacts from previous sprint (if any)
- **Questions Asked**: [count] (view in Sprint page)
- **Next Step**: [determined from graph analysis]

Continuing from where you left off.
```

### Step 4: Load Stage-Specific Context
Before resuming any stage, load relevant artifacts from the graph:

- **Early Stages (Workspace Detection, Reverse Engineering)**: Call `get_sprint_graph` for overview
- **Requirements/Stories**: Call `list_nodes(label: "Requirement")` + any reverse engineering nodes
- **Design Stages**: Call `list_nodes` for Requirements, UserStories, and any design-related nodes
- **Code Stages**: Call `get_sprint_graph` to load ALL artifacts + review existing code files on filesystem
- **For any stage**: Call `list_nodes(label: "Question")` to review previous Q&A context

### Step 5: Resume Execution
Continue with the next incomplete stage following the normal workflow rules.

## Cross-Sprint Context Loading

When starting a **new sprint** (empty graph), the agent should load context from previous sprints to ensure knowledge continuity.

### When to Load Cross-Sprint Context

- **Always** at the start of a new sprint during the Workspace Detection stage
- This happens automatically as part of Step 1.5 in `inception/workspace-detection.md`

### MCP Tools for Cross-Sprint Context

Three tools support cross-sprint knowledge management:

1. **`get_previous_sprint_summary`** — Call at sprint start to understand project history
   - Returns a condensed summary of all previous sprints: names, descriptions, artifact counts, GeneralInfo (design decisions, RE findings), Requirements, and metrics
   - Use this to quickly assess what was done before and what knowledge exists
   - No parameters needed — automatically scoped to the current project

2. **`get_previous_sprint_graph`** — Call when detailed information about a specific previous sprint is needed
   - Returns the full subgraph (nodes + edges) for a specific sprint
   - Takes a `sprintId` parameter — get the ID from `get_previous_sprint_summary` results
   - Use this to deep-dive into a previous sprint's artifacts and their relationships
   - Example: understanding why a particular design decision was made, or reviewing the full requirement chain

3. **`carry_forward_knowledge`** — Call once at sprint start to import relevant knowledge
   - Automatically copies GeneralInfo nodes and Requirement nodes from the most recent previous sprint
   - Creates new nodes in the current sprint with `carried_from_sprint` property
   - Creates `CARRIED_FROM` edges linking back to the originals for traceability
   - Idempotent — safe to call multiple times (will skip if already carried forward)

### Carried-Forward Artifact Identification

Carried-forward artifacts can be identified by:
- **`carried_from_sprint` property**: Contains the source sprint ID
- **`carried_from_id` property**: Contains the original node's ID
- **`CARRIED_FROM` edge**: Directed edge from the new node to the original node
- **ID prefix**: Carried-forward nodes use the `cf-` prefix (e.g., `cf-re-business-overview`)

### Cross-Sprint Context Flow

```
New Sprint Start
    |
    v
get_sprint_graph (empty) --> get_previous_sprint_summary
    |
    v
Previous sprints found? --NO--> Continue normally (greenfield or first sprint)
    |
    YES
    v
carry_forward_knowledge --> Import GeneralInfo + Requirements
    |
    v
ask_question: "Review context / Proceed / Describe changes"
    |
    v
Continue with Workspace Detection Step 2
```

## MANDATORY: Session Continuity Instructions

1. **Always call `get_sprint_graph` first** when detecting an existing sprint
2. **Parse current status** from Sprint node properties and graph structure
3. **Load Previous Stage Artifacts** from the graph before resuming
4. **Smart Context Loading by Stage**: Load only what's relevant for the current stage
5. **Show specific next steps** rather than generic descriptions
6. **Use `ask_question`** if the current state is ambiguous and you need team input on where to resume
7. **For new sprints**: Always check for previous sprint context via `get_previous_sprint_summary` and carry forward knowledge when available

## Error Handling
If the graph is empty or Sprint node is missing, see `common/error-handling.md` for recovery procedures.
